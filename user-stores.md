# User Stores: Bus Mall

Focus Group Participant:
- As a user, I want to be able to click the images for items that I want to purchase and have the page clearly display what I chose.
- As a user, I want to make sure that any images that I saw in one round don't reappear in the subsequent round.
- As a user, I want to know which items I chose the most.
- As a user, I want all of the images to be displayed clearly and in sizes that are fairly similar.
 
Marketing Department:
- As the Bus Mall marketing department, I want my shoppers to make a total of 25 selections before I display results.
- As a marketer, I want to know which items were the most clicked, and the percentage of times that an item was clicked when shown.
- As a marketer, I want the website to be easy for a customer to view: 
    * I want my images to be featured side-by-side for easier viewing.
- As a marketer, I want the results for my data to be easily displayed for viewing. I'd like my focus group results to be in a table, with columns for:
    * Image displayed x times
    * Image clicked x times
    * Image clicked x% of time shown
    * Most popular to least popular numercial ranking

 Developer:
 - As a developer, I want to make sure that my sets of three images iterate 25 times before displaying results.
 - As a developer, I want to keep track of how many times that an item was clicked.
 - As a developer, I want to keep track of how many times that an item was displayed.
 - As a dev, I want to see what percentage of the time an item was clicked while it was displayed, and what percentage of the time it was not clicked.
 - As a dev, I want to use a constructor to store data for:
    * How many times an image was displayed.
    * How many times an image was clicked when it was displayed.
    * The name of the image
    * The name of the file path
- As a dev, I want to create a visually appealing site that a user would enjoy looking at as they shop for silly items.
